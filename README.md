# ATM-Mock-Project
This is an upgraded version of a simple ATM machine. Functions were used to implement minimal bank account opening and bank operations.
It showcases minimal transactions done on a bank ATM when a customer has an account he inputs YES and follows through till done. 
There is an option for registering to open an account if a customer doesn't have one. This time he inputs NO and follows through till when done.
